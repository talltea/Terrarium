TODO:

in no particular order:

* add randomness to fights
* come up with a better fight algorithm in general

* stop biasing towards one species when breeding 

**** inheritable traits when breeding 

* better hunger algorithm
* better feeding algorithm

* timer correct with pause

* real time edits of species specs
* fancy background

* movements more interesting than random walk

* data about # of critters in each species 
* plot data

* optionally wrap around the world

* species that don't move around (grass and water)

* fix random number generators 


DONE: 15

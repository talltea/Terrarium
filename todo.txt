TODO:

in no particular order:

* add randomness to fights
* come up with a better fight algorithm in general

* stop biasing towards one species when breeding 

* inheritable traits when breading 

* species determined traits
	* movement
	* health
	* hunger

* generalize how many species I can have
* implement a better way to display more than 3 species
	(health display with opacity?)

* better hunger algorithm
* better feeding algorithm
* abstract these away into critter

* timer correct with pause

* real time edits of species specs
* fancy background

* movements more interesting than random walk

* code in constants for critters 
* constants for world (so that I don't have to recompile each time for screen size)

* data about # of critters in each species 
* plot data

*optionally wrap around the world


DONE: 6

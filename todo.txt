TODO:

in no particular order:

* add randomness to fights
* come up with a better fight algorithm in general

* stop biasing towards one species when breeding 
* inheritable traits when breading 
* species determined traits

* generalize how many species I can have
* implement a better way to display more than 3 species
	(health display with opacity?)

* hunger algorithm
* feeding algorithm

* timer correct with pause

* real time edits of species specs
* fancy background

* code in constants for critters 
* constants for world (so that I don't have to recompile each time for screen size)


DONE: 6
